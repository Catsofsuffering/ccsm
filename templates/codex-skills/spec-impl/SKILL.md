description: Dispatch execution from Codex and keep acceptance in Codex. Use when the change is planned and ready for implementation.

Implement the planned change while keeping Codex as the host workflow.

**Core contract**

- Codex remains the orchestrator.
- Claude is the execution worker.
- Codex owns testing, acceptance, rework, and archive decisions.

**Steps**

1. Select the active change with `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json`.
2. Read the full execution context from `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and the change specs.
3. Build a bounded execution packet that includes:
   - the implementation goal
   - allowed and protected paths
   - required tests and checks
   - the return packet format
4. Invoke Claude from Codex with a bounded prompt:

```bash
ccsm claude exec --prompt-file .claude/ccsm/claude-dispatch-prompt.txt
```

   The `ccsm claude exec` path resolves the native Claude binary when available, or falls back to the installed Claude JS entrypoint without relying on shell-specific shims.
   In a standard Claude Code install you should not need to set `CCSM_CLAUDE_PATH`; the launcher checks `PATH` first and only uses `CCSM_CLAUDE_PATH` as a fallback override for non-standard installs.
   Preserve your existing proxy settings by default. Only append `127.0.0.1,localhost` to `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` when your environment explicitly needs local bypass; use `CCSM_CLAUDE_APPEND_LOCAL_NO_PROXY=1` for that case.
   For non-interactive Agent Teams execution, `ccsm claude exec` defaults to `--permission-mode=bypassPermissions` so Claude is not blocked by interactive approval gates during delegated execution. Override with `CCSM_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=<mode>` or pass an explicit Claude permission flag when you need a different policy.
   `ccsm monitor hooks` also ensures `~/.claude/settings.json` allows `Bash(*ccsm*)`, and `ccsm monitor install` ensures the current workspace is marked `trusted` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
   Treat `claude -p` as the Claude-side entry contract. Do not assume a separate `claude teammates` CLI command exists.
   If the execution packet requires Agent Teams, enable both `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TASKS=1`, then instruct Claude to use the in-session team tools (`TeamCreate`, `TaskCreate`, `SendMessage`, `Agent(team_name=..., name=...)`) after the Claude session starts.
   Require every teammate prompt to define its mailbox return protocol explicitly: if `SendMessage` is deferred, the teammate must run `ToolSearch select:SendMessage` before its first mailbox reply, and any string reply must include both `summary` and `message`.
   Tell Claude that a teammate is not considered finished just because it goes idle or emits `SubagentStop`; the required report only counts after the team lead receives the teammate mailbox message.
   In non-interactive `claude -p` sessions, require Claude to emit the full return packet before shutdown, then follow the official shutdown order: gracefully shut down teammates, wait for approvals, and run cleanup exactly once.
   If cleanup reports success or `nothing to clean up`, do not let Claude keep retrying cleanup. Treat the last complete return packet as terminal output and stop the host Claude process if it falls into the known shutdown-reminder loop.

5. Review the execution return packet in Codex.
6. Run the required local verification in Codex.
7. If verification fails, keep the change open and produce a rework packet for the next execution cycle.
8. If verification passes, approve archive from Codex with `openspec archive <change-name>`.

**Output**

- execution packet
- return packet
- Codex acceptance decision
- archive approval or rework packet

**Guardrails**

- Do not tell the user to switch into Claude and run legacy slash commands.
- Do not let Claude make the final archive decision.
- Do not archive before Codex verification passes.
