# CCSM Quality Gates - Auto-trigger Rules

When working in a project, automatically invoke the corresponding quality gate skills based on the scenario below. These skills are installed at `~/.ccsm/skills/ccsm/` and can be called directly.

**IMPORTANT**: Skill names do NOT have a `ccsm:` prefix. Use exactly: `verify-security`, `verify-quality`, `verify-change`, `verify-module`, `gen-docs`. Do NOT call `ccsm:verify-security` because that will fail with "Unknown skill".

## Trigger Rules

### New Module Created

When a new module, package, or directory is created with source code:

```text
/gen-docs <module-path>         -> Generate README.md + DESIGN.md skeleton
  -> (after development)
/verify-module <module-path>    -> Check structure completeness
  -> /verify-security <module-path> -> Scan for security vulnerabilities
```

### Code Changes > 30 Lines

When a single task produces code changes exceeding 30 lines:

```text
/verify-change                  -> Analyze change impact, check doc sync
  -> /verify-quality <changed-path> -> Check complexity, code smells, naming
```

### Security-Related Changes

When changes involve authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation, or secrets management:

```text
/verify-security <changed-path> -> Scan for vulnerabilities
```

### Refactoring

When refactoring existing code:

```text
/verify-change                  -> Ensure docs reflect the refactoring
  -> /verify-quality <refactored-path> -> Verify quality improved
  -> /verify-security <refactored-path> -> No new vulnerabilities introduced
```

## Execution Rules

1. **Non-blocking**: Quality gates produce reports but do NOT block delivery unless Critical issues are found.
2. **Chainable**: Run gates in the order specified above; skip if the previous gate fails.
3. **Silent on pass**: Only report findings; do not output "all clear" messages for every gate.
4. **Critical = must fix**: Only `Critical` or `High` severity findings require action before delivery.
5. **Idempotent**: Safe to re-run; the same input produces the same output.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When a task involves 3+ independent files or modules, or 2+ parallel workflows, refer to the multi-agent orchestration skill at `~/.ccsm/skills/ccsm/orchestration/multi-agent/SKILL.md` for:

- Agent role assignment (Lead / Scout / Worker / Soldier / Drone)
- File ownership locking (one writer per file at any time)
- Task decomposition strategy (by file, by module, or by pipeline)
