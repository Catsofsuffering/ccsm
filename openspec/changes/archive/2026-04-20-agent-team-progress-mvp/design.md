## Context

The previous iteration of this change improved the wrapper monitor, but that work no longer matches the product direction.

CCGS is now intentionally optimizing for one maintained path:

- Codex orchestrates
- Claude Agent Teams execute
- Codex reviews and accepts

That decision changes the architecture boundary:

- Monitoring should be attached to Claude-native execution events, not wrapper-managed task abstractions.
- The primary monitor should be a standalone local service and web app, not a page embedded into a Go execution wrapper.
- `codeagent-wrapper` is now a compatibility artifact, not a strategic product surface.

The cloned reference repository at `B:\project\Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor` is a better fit for the maintained path because it already implements the missing pieces:

- Claude hook ingestion
- persistent session/agent/event storage
- WebSocket-based live UI updates
- a richer monitoring dashboard and session analytics surface

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Integrate a Claude hook-based monitor into CCG as the primary monitoring surface.
- Remove `codeagent-wrapper` from the maintained single-path workflow.
- Update install/runtime wiring so Claude hook events are configured and the monitor can be started locally.
- Reuse the upstream monitor architecture where it fits, while trimming it to CCG's supported path.
- Surface OpenSpec change progression inside the monitor so Codex can inspect active changes without leaving the operational dashboard.

**Non-Goals:**

- Preserving `codeagent-wrapper` as a first-class product feature.
- Maintaining multi-backend execution normalization for the primary path.
- Shipping every ancillary feature from the upstream monitor repository on day one.
- Keeping the previous embedded wrapper UI alive as a parallel maintained frontend.

## Decisions

### Decision: Move monitoring to Claude-native hooks

The primary monitoring model will be driven by Claude Code hook events such as session start/end, tool activity, and subagent lifecycle changes.

Why this decision:

- The maintained execution path is Claude Agent Teams, so Claude-native events are the most honest source of truth.
- Hook events give access to session/agent/activity timelines without inventing wrapper-specific task identities.
- The reference monitor already proves this model end-to-end.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep deriving monitoring state from wrapper execution.
  Rejected because wrapper state is no longer the maintained runtime.
- Build a new monitor protocol from scratch.
  Rejected because the reference implementation already covers the needed local architecture.

### Decision: Use the cloned monitor repository as the new primary monitor integration base

CCG will integrate the `Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor` architecture as its primary dashboard instead of continuing the AgentField-inspired wrapper frontend.

Why this decision:

- It matches the Claude-execution-only direction directly.
- It includes a mature React UI and a Node service designed around Claude hooks.
- It removes the need to keep investing in wrapper-specific UI and persistence.

Alternatives considered:

- Continue with the AgentField-inspired wrapper monitor.
  Rejected because it improves the wrong runtime surface.
- Keep only the current minimal wrapper monitor.
  Rejected because it still centers the compatibility layer.

### Decision: Remove wrapper-owned monitoring and wrapper-specific install assumptions from the primary workflow

The maintained install path should configure Claude hooks and the new monitor service, not a wrapper binary and wrapper shell permissions.

Why this decision:

- The current installer, templates, and docs all still teach a wrapper-first model.
- Keeping both as equal first-class paths would create unnecessary product ambiguity.
- The user explicitly wants the single primary path, not an extra layer around it.

Alternatives considered:

- Dual-track support with wrapper and hook monitor both treated as primary.
  Rejected because it preserves complexity without product value.

### Decision: Rebuild the monitor presentation layer on a constrained React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui system

The integrated monitor client should keep React as the host framework, keep Tailwind CSS as the token and layout layer, and adopt shadcn/ui-compatible primitives for the shared interaction surface.

Why this decision:

- The current client already runs on React and Tailwind, so the redesign can stay within the existing runtime instead of introducing a second frontend stack.
- The current UI is still dominated by bespoke page markup, repeated card treatments, and accent usage that do not match the intended product tone.
- shadcn/ui-compatible primitives give the execution step a bounded component vocabulary without forcing a heavy design system rewrite.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep the current utility-only component layer and restyle pages ad hoc.
  Rejected because it would make the redesign inconsistent and harder to review.
- Rebuild the monitor in another framework.
  Rejected because it expands the change surface without product benefit.

### Decision: Use a dark industrial editorial language with one accent and one dominant visual per page

The monitor should feel like an operational publication rather than a SaaS card dashboard: restrained, typographic, and high-contrast, with monochrome structure and a single deep-green accent.

Why this decision:

- The current UI uses multiple accent hues, rounded card repetition, and dashboard conventions that work against the requested product character.
- A Japanese editorial layout model fits a monitoring product that needs hierarchy, rhythm, and discipline instead of decorative density.
- Constraining type, color, and motion forces clearer page structure and makes review objective.

Alternatives considered:

- Preserve the current dashboard aesthetic and only tweak colors.
  Rejected because the structural problems would remain.
- Use multiple status accents to encode more information.
  Rejected because the requested art direction explicitly limits the UI to one accent color.

### Decision: Add an OpenSpec board as a first-class monitor page

The integrated monitor should expose an OpenSpec board that groups changes by workflow stage and summarizes artifact readiness and task progress.

Why this decision:

- Codex owns change progression, so the maintained monitor should show OpenSpec state alongside Claude execution state.
- A board view matches the existing monitor navigation model and gives a quick operational read of which changes are still in artifact creation versus implementation.
- OpenSpec already provides authoritative change and artifact status through its CLI, so the monitor can remain read-only and avoid inventing a second source of truth.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep OpenSpec inspection in the terminal only.
  Rejected because it forces the operator to leave the monitor for a common workflow check.
- Show OpenSpec changes as a flat table on an existing page.
  Rejected because the requested interaction is explicitly board-like and should remain visually parallel to the existing Agent Board.

## Frontend Experience Constraints

- Framework: React client remains the frontend host, with Tailwind CSS for tokens/layout and shadcn/ui-compatible primitives for shared controls.
- Palette: neutrals only for the base UI, with one deep-green accent used for focus, live state, and key emphasis.
- Typography: maximum two font families. Preferred pairing for implementation review is an industrial sans for UI metadata and a Japanese editorial serif for display hierarchy.
- Layout: avoid card-heavy dashboards. Prefer ruled layouts, tables, list ledgers, split columns, pinned rails, and deliberate white-space blocks.
- Page composition: each section should do one job. Each page should have one primary visual anchor only.
- Motion: no more than three motion patterns total across the app. Recommended set is page-enter reveal, live-update signal, and disclosure/expand transitions.
- Responsiveness: the editorial hierarchy must survive mobile and desktop without collapsing into dense card stacks.
- OpenSpec board: group changes into workflow-stage columns derived from artifact completion and task progress; each change tile should emphasize stage, task completion, and next artifact rather than generic dashboard metrics.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Removing wrapper assumptions touches many surfaces at once] -> Mitigation: update OpenSpec boundaries first, then change installer/templates/runtime together.
- [The upstream monitor is larger than the minimum CCG need] -> Mitigation: integrate only the server/client/hook path required for the maintained workflow.
- [Existing compatibility flows may still mention wrapper execution] -> Mitigation: relabel or trim compatibility surfaces as part of this change.
- [Users who relied on wrapper-specific behavior may lose that path] -> Mitigation: this change is explicitly for the maintained single-path workflow; compatibility cleanup can stay bounded and deliberate.

## Migration Plan

1. Re-scope CCG docs/specs/install/runtime from wrapper-first to Claude-hook-first monitoring.
2. Integrate the hook monitor server/client as a local CCG-managed service.
3. Add installer support for Claude hook registration and monitor runtime assets.
4. Remove wrapper-owned monitoring/UI and wrapper-specific execution assumptions from the maintained path.
5. Verify install, hook ingestion, live dashboard behavior, and the revised Codex -> Claude -> Codex loop.

## Open Questions

- Whether `codeagent-wrapper` should remain in the repository temporarily as a compatibility artifact even after it leaves the maintained path.
- Whether the monitor service should be launched explicitly by the user at first, or be managed by a CCG helper command/install-time runtime helper.

## Execution Handoff Contract

### Execution Goal

Replace the wrapper-owned monitoring path with an integrated Claude hook-based monitor aligned to the maintained Codex -> Claude Agent Teams -> Codex workflow, and remove `codeagent-wrapper` from the primary product path.

### Upstream Reference

- Cloned repository: `B:\project\Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor`
- Relevant surfaces inspected: `server/`, `client/`, `scripts/install-hooks.js`, `scripts/hook-handler.js`, `server/routes/hooks.js`
- Key finding: the repository is not just a frontend; it is a complete local monitoring stack built around Claude hooks, persistent state, and a React dashboard.

### Allowed Change Surface

- `src/commands/*`, `src/utils/*`, and related installer/runtime wiring
- New integrated monitor source paths under the main Node workspace
- Claude hook installation and monitor runtime configuration
- Documentation and templates that still present `codeagent-wrapper` as the maintained path
- Removal of wrapper-owned monitoring/UI assets that no longer belong to the maintained workflow

### Protected Surface

- Unrelated MCP features and optional tool integrations unless required by the new monitor path
- OpenSpec changes unrelated to `agent-team-progress-mvp`
- Broad product rewrites outside the execution/monitoring path

### Work Packages

1. Integrate the monitor server/client foundation from `Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor` into CCG.
2. Add installer/runtime support for Claude hook registration and local monitor startup.
3. Repoint CCG docs/templates/config to the single primary path without wrapper-owned monitoring.
4. Remove wrapper monitoring/frontend assumptions and obsolete wrapper-specific runtime wiring from the maintained path.
5. Verify the new monitor path with build/test/install/runtime checks.

### Required Verification

- Integrated monitor frontend build succeeds
- Integrated monitor server tests pass
- Installer/runtime changes for hook setup are verified locally
- Root typecheck/build/test pass where still applicable after the integration
- Any new monitor-specific test command added by this change is run and recorded

### Rework Triggers

- The integration still depends on `codeagent-wrapper` for the maintained path
- Installer changes leave Claude hooks unconfigured or inconsistent
- The resulting monitor cannot represent Claude Agent Teams sessions and agent activity from real hook events
- The single primary workflow still documents wrapper-owned execution as required

### Exact Bounded Packet For `ccg-spec-impl`

- Change id: `agent-team-progress-mvp`
- Execution goal: replace wrapper-owned monitoring with an integrated Claude hook-based monitor and remove `codeagent-wrapper` from the maintained path
- Allowed boundaries: installer/runtime/templates/docs plus new monitor integration surfaces and wrapper-monitor removal
- Protected boundaries: unrelated optional integrations and unrelated OpenSpec changes
- Required verification: integrated monitor build/test, local hook/install verification, root verification commands still relevant after integration
- Next skill: `ccg-spec-impl`

### Frontend Redesign Execution Slice

#### Execution Goal

Redesign the integrated monitor frontend in `claude-monitor/client` so the primary monitoring experience uses React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives, a dark industrial editorial layout, one deep-green accent, at most two fonts, minimal card usage, and only purposeful motion.

#### Allowed Change Surface

- `claude-monitor/client/package.json`
- `claude-monitor/client/tailwind.config.js`
- `claude-monitor/client/src/index.css`
- `claude-monitor/client/src/main.tsx`
- `claude-monitor/client/src/App.tsx`
- `claude-monitor/client/src/components/**`
- `claude-monitor/client/src/pages/**`
- New shared primitives under `claude-monitor/client/src/components/ui/**`
- `claude-monitor/server/routes/**`
- `claude-monitor/server/index.js`
- `claude-monitor/server/openapi.js`

#### Protected Surface

- `claude-monitor/server/**`
- Hook ingestion, persistence, and WebSocket protocol files unless a frontend-only type import must be adjusted
- Data shape contracts in `claude-monitor/client/src/lib/api.ts`, `claude-monitor/client/src/lib/eventBus.ts`, and `claude-monitor/client/src/lib/types.ts` unless required for rendering correctness
- Root installer/runtime wiring in `src/**`
- Unrelated OpenSpec changes

Exception for this slice:

- A read-only server route may be added under `claude-monitor/server` if needed to expose OpenSpec board data without modifying hook ingestion, persistence, or runtime wiring.

#### Work Packages

1. Add the frontend design-system foundation: shadcn/ui-compatible primitives, color/type tokens, and motion utilities inside `claude-monitor/client`.
2. Redesign the shared shell and navigation so the app establishes the editorial tone without leaning on stacked cards.
3. Rebuild the primary monitoring pages (`Dashboard`, `Sessions`, `ActivityFeed`, `SessionDetail`) so each section has one responsibility and each page has one dominant visual.
4. Bring secondary pages into visual alignment without inventing extra hero visuals or new accent colors.
5. Add a read-only OpenSpec board route/page that groups changes by stage and summarizes artifact/task progress.
6. Verify build, tests, responsiveness, reduced-motion behavior, and the constrained visual system.

#### Required Verification

- `pnpm --dir claude-monitor/client build`
- `pnpm --dir claude-monitor/client test`
- `pnpm --dir claude-monitor/server test`
- Manual review of dashboard, sessions, activity feed, and session detail at desktop and mobile widths
- Manual review of the OpenSpec board with repositories that contain active and completed changes
- Manual review that only one accent color is present, no more than two font families are loaded, and animation patterns stay within the approved set

#### Rework Triggers

- The redesign introduces more than one accent color or more than two font families
- The resulting pages still depend on card grids as their default composition pattern
- A page contains multiple competing hero visuals or sections without a single clear responsibility
- Motion is added as decoration rather than communicating load, live state, or disclosure
- The frontend change requires backend protocol or installer changes to function
- The OpenSpec board becomes a writable editor or diverges from `openspec` CLI state instead of reflecting it

#### Exact Bounded Packet For `ccg-spec-impl`

- Change id: `agent-team-progress-mvp`
- Execution goal: redesign the `claude-monitor/client` monitoring UI to the constrained editorial system defined above
- Allowed boundaries: `claude-monitor/client` styles, shared components, page components, and new `components/ui` primitives
- Protected boundaries: server, hook ingestion/runtime wiring, root installer code, and unrelated OpenSpec artifacts
- Required verification: client build/test plus manual checks for responsiveness, accent/font limits, layout discipline, and sparse motion
- Next skill: `ccg-spec-impl`
